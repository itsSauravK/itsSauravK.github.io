        "The linked list that we have looked at so far is called \u2018Singly Linked List\u2019. However, there are other types of linked list as well based on the node structure and how the nodes are connected. In this blog In this blog, we\u2019ll discuss some of the other linked list types and discuss their applications in\u00a0detail.</p>\n<h4>Doubly linked\u00a0List</h4>\n<p>In a doubly lin...",

        "Linked list is a linear data structure and one of the most basic and fundamental data structures. To recap, a linear data structure is the one where elements are ordered sequentially or linearly. As the name suggests, a linked list is a ‘list’ of data elements. In a linked list, every data element is stored in a node. Along with the data, a node also stores the address to the next node in the...",

        "Data Structures! No matter which programming language you are learning, whether it is C, Java, Python, etc., you must have encountered this esoteric term that might have left you flustered and confused. In the beginning, data structures are usually difficult to comprehend and can easily become the achilles heels of your projects and coding interview, if not studied properly. As you develop more familiarity and get the fundamentals right, they can become your forte and can help you solve complex problems easily. So, what are Data...",

This problem can be easily solved by the Bellman Ford algorithm. In other words, this algorithm is used to compute the shortest path from a single source vertex to all other vertices. It uses a dynamic programming approach and can detect negative cycles...",

We tend to make a lot of changes, not only in the code, but also in the structure of the code, tools and other dependencies. There are times when we realise that things are not working as expected and going back to an older version seems like a more feasible solution.",
